# IoT-Based-Weather-Forecasting-Station

This project presents the development of an IoT-based weather station tailored for agricultural applications in rural Sri Lanka. The system aims to address the challenges posed by unreliable weather forecasts by providing farmers with accurate and localized weather data, enabling informed decision-making for various agricultural activities. The weather station incorporates a range of sensors to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and soil moisture. This data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak platform for storage, visualization, and analysis. Machine learning algorithms are employed to analyse the collected data and generate weather forecasts for the next hour and the next day. The system also includes an OLED display for real-time data presentation and utilizes the Arduino programming environment for seamless integration of components. While initial testing and analysis have shown promising results, further development is needed to enhance forecast accuracy and explore additional features, such as integrating external data sources and refining machine learning models. The project's findings highlight the potential of IoT-based weather stations to empower farmers with valuable information, contributing to improved agricultural productivity and sustainability in rural communities.
